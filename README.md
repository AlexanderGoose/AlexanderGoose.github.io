# CSPB 3112 Project Site

This repo contains the code for my project website where I post weekly updates showcasing what I've accomplished and what I plan to do in the coming week. 

This project is motivated by the desire to learn how to use computer programming to investigate ecological data. I plan to utilize my skills in data analysis using programming techniques, and learn additional machine learning tools.
