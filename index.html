                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Last week was quite a diversion. I took a chance and wrote a very non-conventional cover letter and got offered an interview for a data science internship. This meant that last week was spent re-learning a lot of DS concepts, and going over some of my best projects to re-learn how they work so I’m ready for any questions there. I’ve been working through the SQL 50 on Leetcode, and wow, I forgot how much I enjoy SQL. It’s just so intuitive–much more so than what I spent the first half of the course learning, R.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I plan to finish building out my Raspberry Pi GPS tracker. I planned to put it on the back burner for a bit, but it’s on my resume so I better finish it! It’s been a very new experience for me, and I’m excited to see where it goes. Early in the semester when I was learning R by studying lake ecology data, I thought about how much fun it would be to design the hardware used to gather the data. I had a ton of ideas but was very limited due to my income, but with my new job, I can justify a few toys to work with. It’s purely academic, of course.</p>
                <p class="update-item">I’ll also continue grinding through the SQL 50 and studying some interview questions. I’ve been putting the final assignments for computer systems on the back burner, but hopefully, I can find the time to throw something together for the last lab and find a couple more hours to study for the final exam that I’m very unprepared for.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">I recently moved into a home with my aunt and uncle, and they will be moving out this coming week. It’ll be a madhouse, as they’re moving overseas, so I’m sure I’ll end up spending a lot of time helping them. On the flip side, it’ll be a bit easier to study once the place quiets down a bit.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">It’s been nice switching gears, especially getting back into some Leetcode. I haven’t touched LC in many months now, and I’ve been really sad about that. Given how near I am to graduation (hopefully), I should be doing it more. Can’t wait to finish systems so I have time for things like that again.</p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This past week did not see much action. I was moving, taking on new responsibilities at work, and finishing up a systems lab, and I barely had enough time for it all. I did, however, watch a tutorial on Swift, but I didn’t code alongside it. Regardless, it was helpful to get a basic understanding of how it works so I can begin to dive into it soon. I also made some minor changes in the UI of my ski app such as removing the second decimal place in the temperature as that seemed unnecessary. Just some basic cleanup that didn’t require much brain power</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I plan on figuring out the best way to make the app refresh itself. Last week I wrote a script that requires only a simple ‘./bootup’ which then runs 4 different web scrapers, 2 different Python files that merge and re-arrange JSON files, a Python file that normalizes the data, and then it loads up the UI. I’m happy with how simple it is to run the program, so it shouldn’t be hard to do the next step. If I have time this weekend, I’d like to start the very beginning of making the Swift app. Turns out, Python works great as a backend for Swift so this should be a fun and insightful process!</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Time, once again. I will likely spend most of the weekend skiing and unpacking, which I have barely begun to do.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Not much to reflect on given how little was accomplished. However, I knew this would likely be the case which was a big motivator in me spending somewhere between 10-15 hours on personal projects the week before. I’m looking forward to hopefully diving back into things this week if time allows.</p>

                <i class="date">Nov 11 - Nov 17</i><br>
                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Last week was again very productive. I noticed that the weather data I was getting from Open-Meteo API was inaccurate, and it led to a complete overhaul of how I got my data. I was pretty bummed at first, but I ended up learning a lot. I built a separate web scraper for each ski resort using Beautiful Soup and a few other packages. I got kicked from Copper Mountain pretty quickly, so I had to grab its information elsewhere. Then I built out a connection to the Liftie API to get lift information and again, lost access after a few hits. So, I went and scraped that information from the website pages themselves. All in all spent probably 10 hours on this. I recommend everyone inspect the code for A Basin’s website, it is so beautifully done compared to the other sites. So simple and elegant.</p>
                <p class="update-item">Additionally, I changed the UI to display data overviews, which you can see from the picture below. This had to be done because it was becoming too complicated and nested for no reason. I wanted to simplify it as much as possible so that I can later turn it into a swift app. This UI is the rough draft that is helping me form an idea of what I want to include in a real application.</p>
                <p class="update-item">Lastly, for a project at work, I had to look at about 200 different websites and a lot of them were either quite beautiful or very retro, as if they hadn’t been updated in 15 years. I loved them. It made me want to change up my own that evening. I changed it to a light mode, swapped the font to something more elegant, and added a background image to the homepage. I wanted it to feel like an architecture or a design studio website. You can check it out at <a href="https://pygoose.com/" style="color: wheat;">pygoose.com</a> if you’d like. I got a bit frustrated trying to find things in the css file that had approached 800 lines, which led me to scss. It lets you split up your css into multiple files that can then get compiled into one main.css file. Super helpful and I wish I had found this sooner!</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I plan to finalize the data that  I want users to be able to play with. Also, web scraping takes about 17 seconds to run. I’d like to figure out how to run it in the background every few hours if possible so the user never has to wait for it.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">I’m moving this weekend so I won’t be able to spend the whole weekend coding :(</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">Learning new tools was amazing and very motivating as a whole. It felt like quite a drag at some points due to how tedious it can be to troubleshoot web scrapers, but once I got the hang of it I had a lot of fun. I’ve always wanted to learn Beautiful Soup so I’m glad I can check that off the list but I don’t plan to go down that rabbit hole again anytime soon. I am very glad to have started up this project, but it’s gotten to the point where I’ve been a bit obsessive over it, which I tend to do with these sorts of projects. I’ll have to dial it back a bit while I finish out 2400!</p>

                <i class="date">Nov 4 - Nov 10</i><br>
                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Last week I continued on with 1 hour of R instruction and the remaining time was spent on my ski app. I spent most of my time learning how to start with the JSON file I made last week, load it into a Python file, and then play with it from there. I was able to assign scores based on snowfall, visibility, temperature, and wind conditions for three time periods: today, the last 3 days, and the last 7 days. I am still working on this rating system, so if there are any other ski nerds who want to take a look lmk!</p>
                <p class="update-item">Additionally, I normalized those scores and began working on a user interface that currently only runs in a terminal environment. I got this to a working condition just days before the first big snow in Colorado which is exciting! I have been using rain data for the last few weeks instead of snow, so I’ve reconfigured the API call to get the correct data now. It’s been a ton of fun!</p>
                <p class="update-item">Lastly, in keeping up with the theme of trying to keep learning new things that excite me, I learned how to record a screen recording, convert it to a GIF, and then upload that as an image to a website. I am hoping to cancel a few websites and databases I have running to save some money, and I think a demo like this is more efficient than keeping up the real website anyway.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I plan on continuing to build the simple user interface. I would like to make a better road map of what I hope to get done and perhaps make a kanban board for it as it’s starting to turn into a huge project with dozens of TODOs buried within the code.</p>
                <p class="update-item">I’ve also ordered a GPS tracker for my Raspberry Pi, and have plans to build an offline ski tracker. When I get home from skiing, I’ll be able to upload the data to my computer and use some various packages to map out my full day of skiing overlaid on a resort’s trail map. Now that’s what I call a proper apres ski session. However, I may not start this in a few more weeks. I planned to test it with bike rides, but with the recent weather in Denver that’ll have to wait.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">None. Previously the impediment was time, but I am so stoked about this current project that I’ve been working on it almost every evening.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">I’ve been greatly enjoying the balance I’ve found between focusing on the project I chose early in the semester and working on something I’m passionate about now. In hindsight, I wish I had chosen the ski app for the entire semester, but there’s nothing wrong with delayed gratification. </p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Last week I re-learned control flows in R. I did so by writing functions that looped through a list of data frames, then used conditionals to check for certain criteria within them.</p>
                <p class="update-item">Per my post last week, which expressed how much I miss working on personal projects, I decided to spend a lot of time last week doing so. My work in R has in some ways re-taught me how to use Pandas so I re-built a project of mine (in Python) using Pandas and a new API. This led me down the rabbit hole of learning about JSONs for the first time which are fascinating and solve a lot of problems I’ve had in the past. While I spent probably 6 hours on this and only 1 or 2 working in R, I feel as if last week was time well spent. I got a ton of work done and you can see the final JSON I made <a href="https://github.com/AlexanderGoose/ski_report_app/blob/main/current_api/all_resort_weather_data.json">here</a>.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I will also spend an hour working in R and then spending more time on my ski application. I feel as if my project in R has taught me what I wanted to know and I’ve had fun transitioning to something else. Moving forward, my time in R will focus mostly on maintaining my skills rather than trying to learn new niche concepts.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">I started a new job this week which is full-time and it has taken up almost all of my time and brain power. I additionally have been spending a ton of time packing in preparation for my move in 2 weeks. Not much time anymore! Also, I have unfortunately had to switch from my large 4K monitor to an old 1080p monitor I had stuffed in the closet. It’d been a humbling experience but I've survived so far.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">Last week was the most fun I’ve had writing code in a long time. I’m not sure if I’m allowed to abandon my proposed project for this course completely, but if so, I’d be happy to spend my time moving forward working on projects that make me happy. With how limited I am for time now, if I am working on a project I’d prefer to do something fun than something I feel like I have to do. I get enough of that in my systems course :)</p>

                <i class="date">Oct 21 - Oct 27</i><br>
                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This past week focused mostly on my mid-semester project update, which took up a lot of my time with nothing more than general contemplation. To quote directly from my update: “Recently, I have been battling with the frustration of no longer writing code for my classes. I fear this project turning into more of the same: a high-level understanding of something I will never actually use. To avoid this, I hope to engage with a new language in a fun and dynamic way, pursuing what I find interesting and useful at that time.”</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">Perhaps the issues lie more with myself than where I am placing the blame, however, I know that something must change. I am no longer excited by my project, as I have been spending too much time worrying about the best way to approach it and the proper questions to ask. Rather than waste my time with this, I have chosen to have my focus simply on learning R, and using the dataset I have chosen earlier in the semester merely as a vehicle to get me there. I want to learn how to do pandas-y things like merge datasets and create complex filters. I want to learn how to use interesting loops and functions. My current project is severely limiting in allowing me to do these things.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">I plan to focus this week on learning control structures such as loops, conditionals, and functions. My course touched on them very briefly, but I want to go into more depth on these topics. Secondly, I will take some time to upload photos of what I’ve done to my portfolio website for the class. Lastly, I hope to update the weekly plans I first made in my project proposal to reflect the changes in the direction of the project. I may make a list of topics to explore and choose each week what I am in the mood to study.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">My online course is fully transitioning to machine learning, which I plan to hold off on learning. I have found some amazing YouTube channels that explore the concepts I want to focus on for the time being and will come back to the other course later in the semester. That section requires reading a textbook to understand the material. While I am sure it is interesting and helpful to read, I am trying to avoid this type of learning for this project. I want to learn by doing.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">None at this time.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">Last week began frustrating, as I had ideas and questions to ask about the data I was working with, but I felt like I was doing it because I had to. After writing my project update, I am excited to have a change in perspective. I still greatly enjoy the questions I chose last week, such as <i>how do thermal profiles affect the lake’s composition at certain depths</i>, however, I will now use these questions to learn R, instead of learning R to answer the questions. I hope that makes sense. I have had a lot of fun so far this week trying to get back to having fun with programming. For example, I spent a while playing around with theme packages for visualizations, learning how to get specific with styling such as changing title position and size, and adding photos to my website – which let me do one of my favorite things: spending way too much time tweaking the CSS until it’s perfect (which, of course, it never is).</p>
                <p class="update-item">I  think I can make the process work better for me by being a bit more clear with myself on want I hope to learn in my working sessions. I need to pick one thing and stick to it. For example, tomorrow I hope to focus solely on control structures, which will mean I need to step away from visualizations which has been a big focus for the past few weeks.</p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Professor Craven posted on my post last week asking if I could check in with Dr. Oleksy due to my struggles to come up with questions to pursue. This reminded me that she had given me some when I began this project so I dug them up and chose a few to focus on.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">These questions include 1) How has the community changed over time and how have their distributions changed? 2) Look at thermal profiles and determine how they affect the composition at certain depths. 3) How does snowfall impact summer lake distributions? Heavy snowfall years could lead to a later ice-off date, lower lake temperatures as a whole, and less productivity. All of these features are connected to one another!</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">These questions and topics to focus on have given each data frame new life, and I can see the data through a new lens. I spent last week focusing on these topics by trying to find trends by comparing data frames to one another. For example, I compared lake temperature data to the abundance of chlorophyll-a to determine if lower temperatures lead to a lower amount of algal biomass/water productivity.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I plan to go one step further with comparisons of data frames. I plan to merge some together to make better comparisons. I will begin by creating a data frame with both water temperature and algal biomass at specific depths. This will allow me to create better plots as well as run statistical tests to find correlations.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">One feature in the data I was most excited about was the monitoring of about 10 different phytoplankton species. I was devastated to realize that this data ended abruptly in 1985, which is why I am shifting to chlorophyll-a as a substitute.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">After a long interview process, I accepted an amazing new job last week. I am also moving in a month, so the next few weeks are going to be chaotic. I am very nervous about having enough time for all of my schoolwork. Even if I do have time, I hope I can stay motivated instead of feeling like I just have to get through the work.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">Lastly, if I close out of R Studio it gets completely removed from my computer. I have had to reinstall it twice now which is driving me mad. I can’t seem to find any information on this online, so I’ve been making a serious effort to keep it open at all times.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">I greatly enjoyed last week! I created a .Rmd file that contains both graphs and explanations which helped me to feel like I was going somewhere with my project. Previously, I wasn’t taking many detailed notes and was mostly relying on remembering what I had done previously. I now feel much more organized and will continue with this method.</p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Last week was more of the same: slowly exploring the dataset and getting to know the syntax. I had hoped to learn enough to choose some bigger questions to ask, however, I couldn’t think of anything that could lead to a more long-term data exploration project. Though I did create some cool graphs, and I may still expand on them to get them closer to what I am looking for. While I don’t have much to show for what I did last week, I did get to know what my data has to offer and could weed out several data frames as information I know I won’t use.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I plan on diving in to my course a bit more. I am beginning to think that 1) I simply can’t come up with good scientific questions like I used to as a Biology student or 2) This data speaks for itself and isn’t fit for any long-term analysis. Simple graphs and a few statistical tests seem to give me the answers I wanted, which I assumed would take longer.</p>
                <p class="update-item">I will transition into the machine learning aspect of my course, which is what I’ve been waiting for. I am considering a drastic transition to using my data to learn ML instead of using it to find deeper trends in historical data.<p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">I have several job interviews this week which has taken up most of my brain space. After this Friday I should feel less stressed over that and be able to focus a bit more.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">For my LinkedIn Learning task this week, I watched a time management video that said 80% of our work is probably “work that’s just gotta get done” and the other 20% is the important stuff. It then said we shouldn’t spend more than 50% of our time on the 80% stuff. I really needed to hear that, as this semester I have spent more time on busy work because it’s easier. I know when I’m avoiding the hard stuff, and I needed a slap in the face to remind me that’s not a good idea. I plan on trying to spend more time on the 20% this week, but I still need to determine what that is for this course. I think it’ll be fluid and change each week, and this week it’ll be learning the basics of ML in R.</p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Last week’s goal was to begin examining the data set I had picked out, however, it turned into more of a getting-to-know-syntax week. While my course on R has had several mini-practice problems, I realized I was unprepared to dive in as planned. Instead, reviewing my notes and googling to do simple things was a slow process. For example, my data set does not have NA values, instead it used -9999. I wanted to plot the temperatures at 5 meters over 50 years, and the graph was ruined by the -9999 value. It took almost 30 minutes to learn the best way to get rid of this.</p>
                <p class="update-item">I was able to learn a lot about how to implement what I have learned so far and began to make some pretty cool visualizations. I also slowly walked through all ~12 data frames and tried to make sense of what I had so I could start narrowing down what I wanted to focus on.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">My plan for this week is to finish learning what each dataset has to offer so I can pick out some good questions. I spent a little more time on my course learning about more advanced visualizations, and I hope to use that knowledge to find trends in the data.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">None at this time, which is a first! After this weekend I should have much more free time allowing me to get more work done on this project.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">Last week I tried to plow through all of the work in one day, and this actually worked out well initially. However, if I am to do this I think I should still study my notes on R syntax a few times a week so that I stay sharp. I believe that my “what I did last week” focused so heavily on going slowly because I forget many important details when I take 5-6 days off at a time. This week I will try to break up my working sessions into 2 or 3 days and look over my notes, even if for only 5 minutes.</p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This last week I continued on with my course on R. I got distracted with other classes and many other things and did not spend as much time working on the dataset as I had hoped to.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">I am going to take a step back from learning a new language and will focus more on exploring the dataset and re-learning some statistics. I hope that by looking more into the data I can begin to come up with some of my own questions. When I did this with some of the data two weeks ago it gave me some great insights into trends within the data. </p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">I have been reading WAY too much this past week. I seem to be unable to put my Kindle down and will have to make more of a conscious 
                    effort to get my homework done first, and to then read as a reward. I often fall into the trap of convincing myself that reading is good for my brain, therefore, 
                    it makes me a better student. However, that is only the case when I am reading class material!!</p>
                <p class="update-item">Additionally, I have very little time this week. I am going away to Telluride this weekend to look at fall colors and have a concert to 
                    attend on Friday. I work Tues-Thurs, so I am left with very little time. I will dedicate Tuesday morning and evening to this project so that I can get it all 
                    done in one day to avoid pushing it off.</p>
                <p class="update-item">I have been more tired than usual, which has been making it difficult to get work done due to the inability to focus. Not sure what is up with that…</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">Last week was definitely not my best work. With a lot happening in my personal life last week, it was difficult to keep up the momentum that I had set for myself in the first few weeks. I hope to find that again this week and to keep it up for the next. I believe I need to take another look at my project proposal and go into more detail on what I want to have accomplished at certain times. My proposal was vague because it is difficult to know how things will go. I did not know when I would know enough R to use it, how my conversation would go with professors, or how easy the dataset would be to understand. I have (mostly) answered those questions by now, which should allow me to become more organized moving forward.</p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This last week I met with Dr. Oleksy, a professor in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at CU. We discussed my project idea and the dataset I chose and she provided me with some excellent ideas and questions to focus on. I discovered that she knows the PI who works with this dataset so I emailed him and am eagerly awaiting his response once he gets back from the field.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">I spent about three hours working through my online course in R and have made it through the section on dataframes. I then spent some time using what I had learned to begin examining my dataset. The website I discovered the data on has a method of downloading the data using a custom R script which simplified the process for me. I made some simple visualizations, such as a time series plot of lake temperatures at 5 meters over 50 years. I used a linear regression model and discover that the rate of increase can be deemed statistically significant.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I have two main goals. Firstly, to continue working through my online course - I specifically want to get through the next ~4 hours on visualization so that I can begin the section on machine learning. Secondly, I hope to spend some time relearning statistics, especially the basics. I spent some time this weekend relearning p-values, such as what they are, how to find them, and how to read them. I want to continue this, and I will make a plan for future weeks and what I hope to know by then.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Few impediments are in my way this week, the only one is time. I have gotten the ball rolling on this project and I need to refrain from allowing it to take up too much of my time. I have a systems exam this week, personal responsibilities, and other class work.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">My previous weeks were disorganized, so my reflection last week was to get ahead to have these reflections line up better with the dates and to set aside dedicated time to do the work. I have decided that on Mondays I will write my reflection. This is important as it gives me a time to brainstorm what I hope to achieve throughout the week before I begin.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">Also, I have copied the template I made for weekly updates into a Google Doc and this has been wonderful. I will (hopefully) now have significantly less grammatical and spelling errors in my posts.</p>

                <p class="update-item">This next week I will try to get ahead so that my last week's posts are more accurate. I do most of my work on the weekends, which can make the timing awkward for posts due on the Thursday before the weekend.

                <p class="update-item">
                    Last week was spent choosing a project idea and attempting to find a good dataset.
                    I chose to pursue a study of lake sampling data using R, and I chose a dataset that 
                    contains about 50 years of data of various measurments.
                </p>
                <p class="update-item">
                    I reached out to a professor, Dr. Oleksy in the department of Ecology and 
                    Evolutionary Biolgy and asked if she would be willing to assist me in planning
                    out how to approach this project. I have already created a project outline,
                    and she will help me to make sure I am on the right track and asking the right questions.
                    My main worry is not pursuing the right objectives, so her assistance will allow
                    me to puruse the right topics.

                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">
                    This week I created this website using an old github.io link I created a few years back. 
                    I have also 
                    continued to work on my project proposal by outlining measurable goals to strive
                    for throughout the semester. I will continue to add better styling to my website as well
                    as adding in a seperate page dedicated to my project proposal once I have it finalized.

                    The impediment in my way at the moment is time. I am taking possibly too many classes and 
                    I will have to figure out how to budget my time better. I will need to do this to make sure
                    I am able to consistently spend 3-5 hours a week on this class and put in good
                    work on my project. My goal is to pick either one day a week or two two hour sessions to get
                    al of my work done.

                    As mentioned in the impediments of the week, my main refelction is to sit down with a better
                    idea of how much time I will spend on my project and what I hope to get done.
                    Now that I have a better project outline in my proposal, it should be easier to know what I 
                    hope to get done in that working session.
