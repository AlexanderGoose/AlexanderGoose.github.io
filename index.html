                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This last week I met with Dr. Oleksy, a professor in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at CU. We discussed my project idea and the dataset I chose and she provided me with some excellent ideas and questions to focus on. I discovered that she knows the PI who works with this dataset so I emailed him and am eagerly awaiting his response once he gets back from the field.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">I spent about three hours working through my online course in R and have made it through the section on dataframes. I then spent some time using what I had learned to begin examining my dataset. The website I discovered the data on has a method of downloading the data using a custom R script which simplified the process for me. I made some simple visualizations, such as a time series plot of lake temperatures at 5 meters over 50 years. I used a linear regression model and discover that the rate of increase can be deemed statistically significant.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I have two main goals. Firstly, to continue working through my online course - I specifically want to get through the next ~4 hours on visualization so that I can begin the section on machine learning. Secondly, I hope to spend some time relearning statistics, especially the basics. I spent some time this weekend relearning p-values, such as what they are, how to find them, and how to read them. I want to continue this, and I will make a plan for future weeks and what I hope to know by then.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Few impediments are in my way this week, the only one is time. I have gotten the ball rolling on this project and I need to refrain from allowing it to take up too much of my time. I have a systems exam this week, personal responsibilities, and other class work.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">My previous weeks were disorganized, so my reflection last week was to get ahead to have these reflections line up better with the dates and to set aside dedicated time to do the work. I have decided that on Mondays I will write my reflection. This is important as it gives me a time to brainstorm what I hope to achieve throughout the week before I begin.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">Also, I have copied the template I made for weekly updates into a Google Doc and this has been wonderful. I will (hopefully) now have significantly less grammatical and spelling errors in my posts.</p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I purchased a course on R and began to re-learn the fundamentals.</p>
                <p class="update-item">I did some additional minor tweaks to my website for styling and added a template to use each week for project updates.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This next week I plan to focus solely on learning more R, data science techniques, and will play around with sample datasets.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">My meeting with Dr. Oleksy got moved back a week, but this is minor as I haven't yet begun to explore my chosen dataset.</p>
                <p class="update-item">I would like to move my proposed time to focus on this project to a weekday morning or evening so that I can leave my Sunday study sessions available for Computer Systems.</p>
                
    
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">This next week I will try to get ahead so that my last week's posts are more accurate. I do most of my work on the weekends, which can make the timing awkward for posts due on the Thursday before the weekend. Perhaps a good approach is to write my weekly update on the first day of the new week so that it aligns better with the flow of the class.</p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">
                    Last week was spent choosing a project idea and attempting to find a good dataset.
                    I chose to pursue a study of lake sampling data using R, and I chose a dataset that 
                    contains about 50 years of data of various measurments.
                </p>
                <p class="update-item">
                    I reached out to a professor, Dr. Oleksy in the department of Ecology and 
                    Evolutionary Biolgy and asked if she would be willing to assist me in planning
                    out how to approach this project. I have already created a project outline,
                    and she will help me to make sure I am on the right track and asking the right questions.
                    My main worry is not pursuing the right objectives, so her assistance will allow
                    me to puruse the right topics.
                </p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">
                    This week I created this website using an old github.io link I created a few years back. 
                    I have also 
                    continued to work on my project proposal by outlining measurable goals to strive
                    for throughout the semester. I will continue to add better styling to my website as well
                    as adding in a seperate page dedicated to my project proposal once I have it finalized.
                </p>
        
                <b>Impediment in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">
                    The impediment in my way at the moment is time. I am taking possibly too many classes and 
                    I will have to figure out how to budget my time better. I will need to do this to make sure
                    I am able to consistently spend 3-5 hours a week on this class and put in good
                    work on my project. My goal is to pick either one day a week or two two hour sessions to get
                    al of my work done.
                </p>

                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">
                    As mentioned in the impediments of the week, my main refelction is to sit down with a better
                    idea of how much time I will spend on my project and what I hope to get done.
                    Now that I have a better project outline in my proposal, it should be easier to know what I 
                    hope to get done in that working session.
