            <b>What I did last week:</b>
            <p>
                Last week was spent choosing a project idea and attempting to find a good dataset.
                I chose to pursue a study of lake sampling data using R, and I chose a dataset that 
                contains about 50 years of data of various measurments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I reached out to a professor, Dr. Oleksy in the department of Ecology and 
                Evolutionary Biolgy and asked if she would be willing to assist me in planning
                out how to approach this project. I have already created a project outline,
                and she will help me to make sure I am on the right track and asking the right questions.
                My main worry is not pursuing the right objectives, so her assistance will allow
                me to puruse the right topics.
            </p>
    
            <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
            <p>
                This week I created this website using an old github.io link I created a few years back. 
                I converted it to a flask routed application to make it easier to work with. I have also 
                continued to work on my project proposal by outlining measurable goals to strive
                for throughout the semester. I will continue to add better styling to my website as well
                as adding in a seperate page dedicated to my project proposal once I have it finalized.
            </p>
    
            <b>Impediment in my way:</b>
            <p>
                The impediment in my way at the moment is time. I am taking possibly too many classes and 
                I will have to figure out how to budget my time better. I will need to do this to make sure
                I am able to consistently spend 3-5 hours a week on this class and put in good
                work on my project. My goal is to pick either one day a week or two two hour sessions to get
                al of my work done.
            </p>
    
            <b>Reflections on the process I used last week: </b>
            <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
            <p>
                As mentioned in the impediments of the week, my main refelction is to sit down with a better
                idea of how much time I will spend on my project and what I hope to get done.
                Now that I have a better project outline in my proposal, it should be easier to know what I 
                hope to get done in that working session.
            </p>
