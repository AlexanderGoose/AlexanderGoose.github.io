                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Professor Craven posted on my post last week asking if I could check in with Dr. Oleksy due to my struggles to come up with questions to pursue. This reminded me that she had given me some when I began this project so I dug them up and chose a few to focus on.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">These questions include 1) How has the community changed over time and how have their distributions changed? 2) Look at thermal profiles and determine how they affect the composition at certain depths. 3) How does snowfall impact summer lake distributions? Heavy snowfall years could lead to a later ice-off date, lower lake temperatures as a whole, and less productivity. All of these features are connected to one another!</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">These questions and topics to focus on have given each data frame new life, and I can see the data through a new lens. I spent last week focusing on these topics by trying to find trends by comparing data frames to one another. For example, I compared lake temperature data to the abundance of chlorophyll-a to determine if lower temperatures lead to a lower amount of algal biomass/water productivity.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I plan to go one step further with comparisons of data frames. I plan to merge some together to make better comparisons. I will begin by creating a data frame with both water temperature and algal biomass at specific depths. This will allow me to create better plots as well as run statistical tests to find correlations.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">One feature in the data I was most excited about was the monitoring of about 10 different phytoplankton species. I was devastated to realize that this data ended abruptly in 1985, which is why I am shifting to chlorophyll-a as a substitute.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">After a long interview process, I accepted an amazing new job last week. I am also moving in a month, so the next few weeks are going to be chaotic. I am very nervous about having enough time for all of my schoolwork. Even if I do have time, I hope I can stay motivated instead of feeling like I just have to get through the work.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">Lastly, if I close out of R Studio it gets completely removed from my computer. I have had to reinstall it twice now which is driving me mad. I can’t seem to find any information on this online, so I’ve been making a serious effort to keep it open at all times.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">I greatly enjoyed last week! I created a .Rmd file that contains both graphs and explanations which helped me to feel like I was going somewhere with my project. Previously, I wasn’t taking many detailed notes and was mostly relying on remembering what I had done previously. I now feel much more organized and will continue with this method.</p>

                <i class="date">Oct 7 - Oct 13</i><br>
                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Last week was more of the same: slowly exploring the dataset and getting to know the syntax. I had hoped to learn enough to choose some bigger questions to ask, however, I couldn’t think of anything that could lead to a more long-term data exploration project. Though I did create some cool graphs, and I may still expand on them to get them closer to what I am looking for. While I don’t have much to show for what I did last week, I did get to know what my data has to offer and could weed out several data frames as information I know I won’t use.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I plan on diving in to my course a bit more. I am beginning to think that 1) I simply can’t come up with good scientific questions like I used to as a Biology student or 2) This data speaks for itself and isn’t fit for any long-term analysis. Simple graphs and a few statistical tests seem to give me the answers I wanted, which I assumed would take longer.</p>
                <p class="update-item">I will transition into the machine learning aspect of my course, which is what I’ve been waiting for. I am considering a drastic transition to using my data to learn ML instead of using it to find deeper trends in historical data.<p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">I have several job interviews this week which has taken up most of my brain space. After this Friday I should feel less stressed over that and be able to focus a bit more.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">For my LinkedIn Learning task this week, I watched a time management video that said 80% of our work is probably “work that’s just gotta get done” and the other 20% is the important stuff. It then said we shouldn’t spend more than 50% of our time on the 80% stuff. I really needed to hear that, as this semester I have spent more time on busy work because it’s easier. I know when I’m avoiding the hard stuff, and I needed a slap in the face to remind me that’s not a good idea. I plan on trying to spend more time on the 20% this week, but I still need to determine what that is for this course. I think it’ll be fluid and change each week, and this week it’ll be learning the basics of ML in R.</p>

                <i class="date">Sep 30 - Oct 6</i><br>
                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Last week’s goal was to begin examining the data set I had picked out, however, it turned into more of a getting-to-know-syntax week. While my course on R has had several mini-practice problems, I realized I was unprepared to dive in as planned. Instead, reviewing my notes and googling to do simple things was a slow process. For example, my data set does not have NA values, instead it used -9999. I wanted to plot the temperatures at 5 meters over 50 years, and the graph was ruined by the -9999 value. It took almost 30 minutes to learn the best way to get rid of this.</p>
                <p class="update-item">I was able to learn a lot about how to implement what I have learned so far and began to make some pretty cool visualizations. I also slowly walked through all ~12 data frames and tried to make sense of what I had so I could start narrowing down what I wanted to focus on.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">My plan for this week is to finish learning what each dataset has to offer so I can pick out some good questions. I spent a little more time on my course learning about more advanced visualizations, and I hope to use that knowledge to find trends in the data.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">None at this time, which is a first! After this weekend I should have much more free time allowing me to get more work done on this project.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">Last week I tried to plow through all of the work in one day, and this actually worked out well initially. However, if I am to do this I think I should still study my notes on R syntax a few times a week so that I stay sharp. I believe that my “what I did last week” focused so heavily on going slowly because I forget many important details when I take 5-6 days off at a time. This week I will try to break up my working sessions into 2 or 3 days and look over my notes, even if for only 5 minutes.</p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This last week I continued on with my course on R. I got distracted with other classes and many other things and did not spend as much time working on the dataset as I had hoped to.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">I am going to take a step back from learning a new language and will focus more on exploring the dataset and re-learning some statistics. I hope that by looking more into the data I can begin to come up with some of my own questions. When I did this with some of the data two weeks ago it gave me some great insights into trends within the data. </p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">I have been reading WAY too much this past week. I seem to be unable to put my Kindle down and will have to make more of a conscious 
                    effort to get my homework done first, and to then read as a reward. I often fall into the trap of convincing myself that reading is good for my brain, therefore, 
                    it makes me a better student. However, that is only the case when I am reading class material!!</p>
                <p class="update-item">Additionally, I have very little time this week. I am going away to Telluride this weekend to look at fall colors and have a concert to 
                    attend on Friday. I work Tues-Thurs, so I am left with very little time. I will dedicate Tuesday morning and evening to this project so that I can get it all 
                    done in one day to avoid pushing it off.</p>
                <p class="update-item">I have been more tired than usual, which has been making it difficult to get work done due to the inability to focus. Not sure what is up with that…</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">Last week was definitely not my best work. With a lot happening in my personal life last week, it was difficult to keep up the momentum that I had set for myself in the first few weeks. I hope to find that again this week and to keep it up for the next. I believe I need to take another look at my project proposal and go into more detail on what I want to have accomplished at certain times. My proposal was vague because it is difficult to know how things will go. I did not know when I would know enough R to use it, how my conversation would go with professors, or how easy the dataset would be to understand. I have (mostly) answered those questions by now, which should allow me to become more organized moving forward.</p>

                <b>What I did last week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This last week I met with Dr. Oleksy, a professor in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at CU. We discussed my project idea and the dataset I chose and she provided me with some excellent ideas and questions to focus on. I discovered that she knows the PI who works with this dataset so I emailed him and am eagerly awaiting his response once he gets back from the field.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">I spent about three hours working through my online course in R and have made it through the section on dataframes. I then spent some time using what I had learned to begin examining my dataset. The website I discovered the data on has a method of downloading the data using a custom R script which simplified the process for me. I made some simple visualizations, such as a time series plot of lake temperatures at 5 meters over 50 years. I used a linear regression model and discover that the rate of increase can be deemed statistically significant.</p>
        
                <b>What I plan to do this week:</b>
                <p class="update-item">This week I have two main goals. Firstly, to continue working through my online course - I specifically want to get through the next ~4 hours on visualization so that I can begin the section on machine learning. Secondly, I hope to spend some time relearning statistics, especially the basics. I spent some time this weekend relearning p-values, such as what they are, how to find them, and how to read them. I want to continue this, and I will make a plan for future weeks and what I hope to know by then.</p>
        
                <b>Impediment(s) in my way:</b>
                <p class="update-item">Few impediments are in my way this week, the only one is time. I have gotten the ball rolling on this project and I need to refrain from allowing it to take up too much of my time. I have a systems exam this week, personal responsibilities, and other class work.</p>
        
                <b>Reflections on the process I used last week:</b>
                <i>How can I make the process work better?</i>
                <p class="update-item">My previous weeks were disorganized, so my reflection last week was to get ahead to have these reflections line up better with the dates and to set aside dedicated time to do the work. I have decided that on Mondays I will write my reflection. This is important as it gives me a time to brainstorm what I hope to achieve throughout the week before I begin.</p>
    
                <p class="update-item">Also, I have copied the template I made for weekly updates into a Google Doc and this has been wonderful. I will (hopefully) now have significantly less grammatical and spelling errors in my posts.</p>

I do most of my work on the weekends, which can make the timing awkward for posts due on the Thursday before the weekend.

                <p class="update-item">
                    Last week was spent choosing a project idea and attempting to find a good dataset.
                    I chose to pursue a study of lake sampling data using R, and I chose a dataset that 
                    contains about 50 years of data of various measurments.
                </p>
                <p class="update-item">
                    I reached out to a professor, Dr. Oleksy in the department of Ecology and 
                    Evolutionary Biolgy and asked if she would be willing to assist me in planning
                    out how to approach this project. I have already created a project outline,
                    and she will help me to make sure I am on the right track and asking the right questions.
                    My main worry is not pursuing the right objectives, so her assistance will allow
                    me to puruse the right topics.

                <p class="update-item">
                    This week I created this website using an old github.io link I created a few years back. 
                    I have also 
                    continued to work on my project proposal by outlining measurable goals to strive
                    for throughout the semester. I will continue to add better styling to my website as well
                    as adding in a seperate page dedicated to my project proposal once I have it finalized.

                    The impediment in my way at the moment is time. I am taking possibly too many classes and 
                    I will have to figure out how to budget my time better. I will need to do this to make sure
                    I am able to consistently spend 3-5 hours a week on this class and put in good
                    work on my project. My goal is to pick either one day a week or two two hour sessions to get
                    al of my work done.

                    As mentioned in the impediments of the week, my main refelction is to sit down with a better
                    idea of how much time I will spend on my project and what I hope to get done.
                    Now that I have a better project outline in my proposal, it should be easier to know what I 
                    hope to get done in that working session.
