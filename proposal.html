            <h3>Vision Statement</h3>
            <p class="prop-item">
                This project is motivated by the desire to learn how to use computer programming 
                to investigate ecological data. This project will encourage me to learn more 
                complex programming with R as well as data cleaning, mining, analysis, and 
                visualization. All of these skills I have learned, mostly in theory, but I have 
                not had to implement them to this extent. This project will broadly focus on 
                finding interesting patterns using a long term study of Castle Lake in Northern 
                California, a glacial lake sitting above 5,500 feet.

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p class="prop-item">
                This project is important to me because I have a deep interest in high alpine ecology, 
                particularly glacial lakes and tundras. My focus centers on the questions of how 
                warming temperatures are influencing the ecological composition of these lakes. 
                More specific goals will be an attempt to find major disturbances and determine 
                their impact on lake ecology. This could include sudden changes in water temperature 
                and its impact on phytoplankton communities. Further, I hope to create a long term analysis 
                that attempts to find how rising air and water temperatures are influencing lake composition 
                including nutrients, dissolved inorganic and organic carbon, and plankton concentrations.

            <p class="prop-item"> 
                The dataset I am using, <i>Mountain Lake Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Climate Data since 
                1959 at Castle Lake</i> (Chandra et al., 2022), includes roughly 50 years of data that comes 
                from sampling taken every five days at various depths. These samples include water temperatures 
                between the years 1959 to 2020, chlorophyll concentrations, and nutrient levels at various 
                depths from 1968 to 2020.

            <h3>Risks to Project Completion</h3>
            <p class="prop-item">1 - Learning R. This will involve learning a new language as well 
                as learning how to use it for ecological analysis. I want to ensure I am utilizing best practices.</p>
            <p class="prop-item">Not asking the right questions.</p>
            <p class="prop-item">Making incorrect assumptions/drawing innacurate conclusions.</p>
            <p class="prop-item">Not actually finding interesting patterns within the data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">
            <h3>Mitigation Strategies for Risks</h3>
            <p class="prop-item">1 - I will be meeting with Dr. Isabella Oleksy on September 9th, who 
                is a professor in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and focuses on high alpine 
                lakes. She will help me in forming the right questions to ask so that I can ensure this project 
                is motivated correctly.</p>
            <p class="prop-item"">2 - There is an abundance of information out there that teaches how to use R for 
                biology. I will take the time to research and practice with simple datasets before I attempt 
                to work on my chosen data set.</p>

        <div class="section-title">
            <h3>Specific and Measurable Goals</h3>
            <b>Weeks 1 - 4</b>
            <p class="prop-item">
                - Take an online course in R. I have learned it briefly before, however, I will need a good 
                refresher on how to navigate R Studio, import packages, etc. R comes with many built in data 
                sets that I can play around with to familiarize myself with how it works.
            </p>
            <p class="prop-item">
                - Work with Dr. Oleksy to create an outline of questions to consider that expand on my motivated statement.
            </p>
            <br>

            <b>Weeks 5 - 8</b>
            <p class="prop-item">
                - Begin an in depth analysis of the data in R. Possibly build a SQL database for it to learn how 
                the process works of transferring data between SQL and R Studio.
            </p>
            <p class="prop-item">
                - At the end of this chunk I should be able to have a clear understanding of how warming temperatures affect 
                the measurables within the dataset over time.
            </p>
            <br>

            <b>Weeks 9 - 12</b>
            <p class="prop-item">
                - Here I will begin to learn more about R and look into computational biology algorithms. While the first few weeks focus on more basic statistics, this next chunk will focus on learning subject specific techniques and algorithms used. This will involve research into what is common in the field and how I can use those techniques for this project.
            </p>
            <p class="prop-item">
                - I am allowing myself many weeks for the data analysis portion as there will likely be much more to learn about R along the way. I will also be slowly re-learning techniques learned in previous classes such as data mining and data science strategies.
            </p>
            <p class="prop-item">
                - At the end of this period I will have enough data to begin creating visuals of the data and begin a written report of my findings.
            </p>

            <b>Weeks 13 - 16</b>
            <p class="prop-item">
                - This time will focus on creating visualizations of the data and using them to start building a mini presentation. I would like to pretend I am creating a report to showcase at a conference. This will involve choosing the most important or interesting patterns that I found during my analysis. During this time I will likely need to modify some of my analysis techniques as I aim to craft a narrative out of the findings.
            </p>
            <br>

            <b>Weeks 17 - 18</b>
            <p class="prop-item">
                - Go through the entire project from start to finish and clean it up. I will use this time to make sure my project is presentable and well structured.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">
            <h3>Projects Assessment of Completion</h3>
            <p class="prop-item">
                This project will be done when I have a completed presentation of the data that I can show to 
                people and they would be able to clearly see the trends and patterns that I have found during 
                my analysis.
